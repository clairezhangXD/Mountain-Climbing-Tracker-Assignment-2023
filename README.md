## Claire's Takeaways

Theory concepts applied/learned:
- time complexities
- hash table
- linked stack
- binary search
- merge sort

## Getting Started

Instructions are extremely similar to those of A1:

* Get a virtual environment up and running
* `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (Replacing python with python3 or py - whatever works)

## Running the GUI

`python main.py`

## Running the Tests

`python run_tests.py`

## Running just some of the Tests

`python run_tests.py 1` will run all tests marked with `@number("1.x")`.
